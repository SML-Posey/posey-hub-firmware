# Posey Hub Firmware

Firmware for Posey BLE IMU board hub.
The hub unit connects to up to four Posey devices via a 2M coded PHY for extended range.
Sensor data is collected over BLE and sent over USB (the device registers as a CDC ACM USB device).
The firmware is meant to run on an nRF Thingy:53, or an nRF5340-DK.
